Version 1.4.3 (released 2022-02-18)

Version 1.4.2 (released 2021-05-11)

  invenio packages that will render templates.

Version 1.4.1 (released 2020-12-17)

- Remove pytest-celery because it's still an alpha release.

Version 1.4.0 (released 2020-09-16)

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: Changes to use isort, pycodestyle and pydocstyle via
  pytest plugins. You need to update `pytest.ini` and remove the ``--pep8``
  from the addopts and instead add ``--isort --pydocstyle --pycodestyle``:

  .. code-block:: ini

      addopts = --isort --pydocstyle --pycodestyle ...

  In `./run-tests.sh` script you should also remove calls to pydocstyle and
  isort as both are now integrated with pytest.

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: Upgrade dependencies: coverage, pytest-flask,
  check-manifest, pytest. You need to set the pytest-flask live server
  fixture scope in your pytest config:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [pytest]
     live_server_scope = function

- Decommission pytest-pep8 (last release in 2014) in favour of pycodestyle.

Version 1.3.4 (released 2020-09-15)

- Add `entrypoints` fixture to allow injecting extra entry points during
  testing so that you avoid manual registration of e.g. mappings and schemas.

Version 1.3.3 (released 2020-08-27)

- Add `docker-services-cli` as dependency to enable Invenio modules to
  perform reproducible tests.

Version 1.3.2 (released 2020-05-19)

- Move check-manifest, coverage, isort, pydocstyle, pytest-flask and
  pytest-pep8 from test to install requirements to provide them as centrally
  managed dependencies.
