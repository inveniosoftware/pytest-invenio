"""Pytest plugin for Invenio.

The plugin adds fixtures to help with creation of applications as well as
configuring and initializing the database and search engine.

Additional the plugin helps with configuring end-to-end tests with selenium
and taking screenshots of failed selenium tests (useful for inspecting why
the test failed on CI systems).
